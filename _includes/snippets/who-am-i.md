# Who Am I?

I'm a software developer currently living Vancouver, BC and working at Hootsuite.

Born and raised in Victoria, BC. After graduating from St. Michael's University School in 2009 (and getting my first taste of web dev along the way), I continued my studies at UBC where I majored in Computer Science.

It was my time at UBC where I feel I grew the most. Becoming an executive of the UBC Badminton Club and taking a 2 year contract with SAP was just a couple of the impactful thing that happened during my time there.

Aside from my regular coding activities; I've competed in badminton since I was 8, into street photography (OM-D E-M5/17MMF1.8 30MM-EFL), somewhat of a fashionista (in Rick Owens we trust), and love to eat/drink/travel.

# What do I do?

I love to code. In particular, I love to develop solutions which solve complex problems and present them in a way which is consumable to a general audience. This is the core reason I enjoy coding for the web. Now, I'll be the first to say that vanilla JS is a far-cry from what I'd consider "enjoyable", but the direction the web has going in the past couple years has made it one fastest and exciting fields to develop in; Typescript and Babel are normalizing the mess that's cross browser support and ES6 is adding some organizational sanity to a prototyped language. Throw in some React and Redux and we have component based UI's and fast/understandable uni-directional data flow. What's not to love?

## My stack

I've been lucky enough to get play with quite a few languages/frameworks over the years and have developed quite a personal taste in what I find 'enjoyable'.

Development is changing incredibly rapidly right now and with good reason. More and more, I'm seeing people fall back in love with typed languages thanks to LLVM and it allowing the emergence of modern typed languages that aren't Java or a C derivative.

### Front

For front end web development, the combo of TypeScript and React have made JS development fun again. Microsoft and Facebook both hit it out of the park with these two projects and the rate adoption of the them is proof enough.

We went through the years of crazy DOM manipulation with jQuery, monolith apps with Ember and Angular, and have emerged the other side with a paradigm that everyone seems to have fallen in love with; components! Oddly enough, this paradigm reminds me of the visual basic days. I wonder if we'll ever have Visual Basic-esque IDE for React... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Back

For backend, it's hard to escape PHP. Facebook's HHVM and HackLang have offered noticeable improvements in both increasing performance for PHP5 and improving the language overall. However, even with Symfony's rather beautiful dependency injection and composer for package management, its' still no Rails; which I consider to be the most beautiful abstraction for web-dev ever made.

For solving more complex problems, recently, I've recently been playing with a couple newer languages. Internally on my team at Hootsuite, we use PHP/Hack on Facebook's HHVM; and while Hack is a noticeable improvement over PHP, the tooling support isn't quite there yet... sorry nuclide ᵟຶᴖ ᵟຶ. If anything gets too big for PHP to handle, my goto's tend to be Node for async stuff, Ruby for complex stuff, or most recently Go for computationally heavy/mathy stuff (having proper types again is always nice such a joy).

### Isomorph... ah... wah?

"Isomorphic" apps have been becoming more and more popular these days and for a somewhat good reason. Being able to write code that runs on both the client and server and have them seamlessly communicate with each other over a socket is quite impressive. The most popular framework for this is of course Meteor. I've used it in the past, and while very powerful, have found it a bit too heavy handed for my tastes (which is quite something coming from a Rails lover). Choosing to go Oprah style with sockets (you get a socket! and you get a socket!...), as well as, until 1.3, being unable to properly integrate with NPM were kinda deal breakers for me.
